# Search Engine Component Test Cases

## 1. Web Crawler

**Unit Test Cases**
- Fetch a valid URL and verify HTML is returned.
- Handle unreachable URL gracefully (timeout, error).
- Respect robots.txt restrictions for disallowed URLs.

**Integration Test Cases**
- Crawl a website with multiple pages and verify all expected links are discovered.
- Store and log crawled data in the expected format.

**Performance Test Cases**
- Crawl 1000 pages within a set time limit and measure throughput.

---

## 2. Document Processor

**Unit Test Cases**
- Parse HTML and extract main content, title, and meta tags.
- Remove scripts and styles from document.
- Normalize text (case conversion, stopword removal).

**Integration Test Cases**
- Process a batch of crawled documents and verify structured output.

---

## 3. Indexer

**Unit Test Cases**
- Tokenize and normalize input text correctly.
- Add new documents to the index and verify entry.
- Remove document from index and verify deletion.

**Integration Test Cases**
- Search for a term and verify correct set of documents is returned.
- Update a document and verify index is updated.

**Performance Test Cases**
- Index 10,000 documents and measure indexing speed.

---

## 4. Query Processor

**Unit Test Cases**
- Parse user query and handle synonyms/spelling corrections.
- Support AND/OR and phrase queries.

**Integration Test Cases**
- Process queries against the index and check returned document IDs.

---

## 5. Ranking Engine

**Unit Test Cases**
- Score a document using TF-IDF/BM25/PageRank and verify correctness.
- Sort a list of documents by relevance.

**Integration Test Cases**
- Rank results for sample queries and verify expected order.

**Regression Test Cases**
- Compare ranking before and after algorithm updates to verify improvements.

---

## 6. Frontend/UI

**Unit Test Cases**
- Search input field accepts queries and triggers search.
- Render search results and handle empty results.

**Integration Test Cases**
- End-to-end flow: user submits query â†’ results displayed.
- Responsive layout on mobile and desktop.

**Usability Test Cases**
- Accessibility checks (screen reader, keyboard navigation).

---

## 7. API Layer

**Unit Test Cases**
- Endpoint returns correct response for valid search request.
- Handles invalid requests and returns error messages.

**Integration Test Cases**
- Frontend calls API and receives expected results.

---

## 8. Monitoring & Analytics

**Unit Test Cases**
- Log user queries and clicks.
- Generate basic metrics (query count, errors).

**Integration Test Cases**
- Analytics dashboard displays correct data from logs.

---

## 9. Infrastructure & DevOps

**Unit Test Cases**
- Deployment script successfully deploys service.
- Backup and restore procedures work correctly.

**Integration Test Cases**
- System remains operational during scaling up/down.

**Recovery Test Cases**
- Simulate component failure and verify system recovery.

---

# General Guidelines

- Automate tests using CI/CD pipelines.
- Ensure coverage of edge cases and error conditions.
- Use real-world data for integration and performance tests.
- Document expected behavior and test data for each case.
