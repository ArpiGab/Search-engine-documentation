# Search Engine Technical Documentation

This document describes the architecture, responsibilities, interfaces, and testing guidelines for the main components of the search engine project.

---

## 1. Web Crawler

**Purpose:**  
Discover and download web content from specified URLs.

**Responsibilities:**
- Start from seed URLs, crawl pages, and follow links recursively.
- Respect robots.txt and site crawl policies.
- Store raw HTML content and basic metadata (URL, crawl time, content type).

**Key Interfaces:**
- Input: List of seed URLs, crawl policies.
- Output: Raw HTML files, crawl logs, discovered URLs.

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Use asynchronous requests for scalability.
- Implement politeness (rate limiting, concurrent requests).
- Store output in a structured format (e.g., JSON, database).

**Testing:**
- Unit: Test URL fetching, HTML storage, robots.txt handling.
- Integration: Simulate a crawl on a test site, verify all pages are fetched and logged as expected.
- Performance: Measure crawl speed and resource usage.

## 2. Document Processor

**Purpose:**  
Parse and clean raw HTML, extract main content and metadata.

**Responsibilities:**
- Parse HTML to extract text, title, meta tags, and links.
- Remove scripts, styles, and irrelevant content.
- Normalize text (lowercase, remove stopwords, stemming/lemmatization).

**Key Interfaces:**
- Input: Raw HTML files.
- Output: Cleaned document objects (text, metadata, links).

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Use libraries for parsing (e.g., BeautifulSoup).
- Modularize extraction functions for easy testing.

**Testing:**
- Unit: Test HTML parsing and cleaning on various edge-case documents.
- Integration: Verify document output matches expected structure and content.

## 3. Indexer

**Purpose:**  
Build and maintain an inverted index for efficient query processing.

**Responsibilities:**
- Tokenize and normalize document text.
- Update index with new or changed documents.
- Support fast query lookup (word â†’ document list).

**Key Interfaces:**
- Input: Cleaned document objects.
- Output: Inverted index (can be file-based or database).

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Choose appropriate data structures (hashmaps, databases).
- Support incremental index updates.

**Testing:**
- Unit: Test tokenization, normalization, index updates.
- Integration: Validate index correctness with sample and edge-case documents.
- Performance: Benchmark query response times.

---

## 4. Query Processor

**Purpose:**  
Parse user queries, retrieve matching documents from the index.

**Responsibilities:**
- Tokenize and normalize user input.
- Support query expansion (synonyms, spelling correction).
- Fetch candidate documents from the index.

**Key Interfaces:**
- Input: User queries (text).
- Output: List of candidate document IDs.

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Reuse normalization logic from indexer.
- Support advanced query features (AND/OR, phrase search).

**Testing:**
- Unit: Test query parsing and expansion.
- Integration: Test queries against sample index, validate result sets.

## 5. Ranking Engine

**Purpose:**  
Score and rank candidate documents for relevance to the query.

**Responsibilities:**
- Implement ranking algorithms (TF-IDF, BM25, PageRank, custom ML).
- Support personalization (user profile, history) if required.
- Sort results for final presentation.

**Key Interfaces:**
- Input: Candidate document IDs, query features.
- Output: Ranked list of document IDs.

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Modularize ranking logic for easy experimentation.
- Store ranking metrics for testing and analysis.

**Testing:**
- Unit: Test scoring functions with known inputs.
- Integration: Validate ranking output on sample queries.
- Regression: Compare ranking changes after updates.

## 6. Frontend/UI

**Purpose:**  
Provide a user interface for search and result display.

**Responsibilities:**
- Search input, result rendering, pagination.
- Autocomplete, suggestions, filters.
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile.

**Key Interfaces:**
- Input: User search queries.
- Output: Displayed search results.

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Use modern web frameworks (React, Vue).
- Ensure accessibility and usability.

**Testing:**
- Unit: Test UI components, forms.
- Integration: End-to-end tests for search and result display.
- Usability: Conduct user acceptance tests.

---

## 7. API Layer

**Purpose:**  
Expose search engine capabilities to frontend and external clients.

**Responsibilities:**
- RESTful endpoints for search, suggestions, analytics.
- Authentication, rate limiting, error handling.

**Key Interfaces:**
- Input: HTTP requests (search, analytics).
- Output: JSON responses (search results, suggestions).

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Use established frameworks (Express, Flask).
- Document endpoints (OpenAPI/Swagger).

**Testing:**
- Unit: Test endpoint logic and error cases.
- Integration: Test API with frontend, measure response times.

---

## 8. Monitoring & Analytics

**Purpose:**  
Track system health, user behavior, and search quality.

**Responsibilities:**
- Log system metrics (latency, errors).
- Analyze user queries, clicks, and engagement.
- Generate reports for optimization.

**Key Interfaces:**
- Input: Component logs, user actions.
- Output: Dashboards, alerts, reports.

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Use monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana).
- Anonymize user data for privacy.

**Testing:**
- Unit: Test log generation and parsing.
- Integration: Validate analytics outputs against simulated data.

---

## 9. Infrastructure & DevOps

**Purpose:**  
Deploy, scale, and maintain the search engine system.

**Responsibilities:**
- Containerize components (Docker), orchestrate (Kubernetes).
- Automate builds, tests, deployment (CI/CD).
- Manage backups, disaster recovery, and scaling.

**Key Interfaces:**
- Input: Source code, configuration files.
- Output: Running services, deployment logs.

**Implementation Guidelines:**
- Write infrastructure as code (IaC).
- Document runbooks for operations.

**Testing:**
- Unit: Test deployment scripts.
- Integration: Run system tests on staging before production.
- Recovery: Simulate failure scenarios.

---

# Appendix: General Testing Guidelines

- **Unit Tests:** Each module should be covered by unit tests, ideally >80% coverage.
- **Integration Tests:** Simulate real-world workflows between components.
- **Performance Tests:** Benchmark key operations (crawl speed, query latency).
- **Security Tests:** Validate authentication, data privacy, and error handling.
- **Acceptance Tests:** End-to-end scenarios for user stories.
